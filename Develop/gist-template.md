# Email Validation Regex

Introductory paragraph 
Regular expressions are powerful tools for pattern matching used in various programming languages. In this tutorial, we will dissect a specific regular expression used for email validation. Understanding the components of this regular expression will shed light on how it verifies the format of an email address. Each part of the regex will be broken down and explained, ensuring a clear understanding of its functionality.

## Summary

The featured regex aims to validate email addresses. It comprises a pattern that checks the structure of an email, ensuring it follows a standard format. The pattern is as follows:

const emailRegex = /^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/;

## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors specify the position in the string where the regex pattern should start or end matching. In the email regex, `^` denotes the start of the line, ensuring the pattern begins at the start of the string, and `$` signifies the end, ensuring the pattern extends to the end of the string.

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers specify the quantity or range of characters to match. For instance, + after a character class like `[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]` means that one or more of these characters should be present.

### OR Operator
The `1` symbol represents the OR operator, allowing the pattern to match either the expression before or after the operator. In the email regex, it is used to separate different parts of the email address pattern.

### Character Classes
Character classes like `[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]` define a set of characters. In the regex, this class checks for valid characters that can be used in the local part of an email address.

### Flags
Flags in regex, such as global (`g`), case-insensitive (`i`), or multi-line (`m`), alter the behavior of the pattern matching. However, the email regex in this tutorial doesnâ€™t utilize any flags.

### Grouping and Capturing
Parentheses `()` are used for grouping parts of a pattern together. They also capture the matched text. In the email regex, parentheses are not used for capturing specific parts.

### Bracket Expressions
Bracket expressions, denoted by `[]`, define a set of characters to match. In the email regex, they are used for character classes like `[a-zA-Z]`.

### Greedy and Lazy Match
The `+` quantifier in the email regex is greedy, meaning it matches as many characters as possible to fulfill the pattern.

### Boundaries
Boundaries like `^` and `$` in the email regex ensure that the pattern matches the entire string from start to end.

### Back-references
Back-references are not used in the email regex pattern.

### Look-ahead and Look-behind
Look-ahead and look-behind assertions are not applied in the email regex.
